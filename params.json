Now I want to open-source it,\r\nbut drop legacy code and write it cleanly from scratch without having it stick too much\r\nto a brand. Ideally, I want anyone with a VPS to be able to run a chat like this.\r\n\r\n### Supposed advantages over other solutions\r\n\r\nThis chat is built to work with other authentication systems rather than contain one of its own.\r\nSo it should be easier to integrate with websites generally. It should also be robust and lightweight.\r\n\r\n### Technologies used\r\n\r\nEventMachine as the server framework with the EM-Websockets gem to handle WebSocket connections, and Redis for\r\npersistent memory and sessions.\r\n\r\n### To-do\r\n\r\n* Add methods for authentication and changing of user attributes using commands\r\n* Add some kind of HTTP handler to serve the HTML/JS/CSS\r\n* Consider EventMachine defers to optimize responsiveness\r\n"}
